# Genetic evidence enrichment pipeline for CACHE

## Set up the environment
```bash
python3 -m venv env
python3 -m pip -q install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download the data
```bash
# Open Targets Platform release.
export RELEASE=21.04
export DATASETS="targets diseases associationByDatatypeDirect"
for DATASET in ${DATASETS}; do
  wget --recursive --no-parent --no-host-directories --cut-dirs 8 \

# UniProt to Ensembl mapping.
echo -e 'UniProt\ttargetId' > uniprot_ensembl_mapping.tsv
wget -qO- https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/idmapping/by_organism/HUMAN_9606_idmapping_selected.tab.gz \
  | gzip -cd | cut -d$'\t' -f1,19 >> uniprot_ensembl_mapping.tsv
```

The input list of targets is generated upstream and shared over email.

## Run
```bash
source env/bin/activate
python3 cache-genetic-evidence.py \
  --upstream-targets CACHE_List_SAR_GWAS_DiseaseV2.csv \
  --uniprot-ensembl-mapping uniprot_ensembl_mapping.tsv \
  --association-threshold 0.7
```

## Current results

This section is generated by the pipeline on each run.

### Identifier mapping statistics
Total UniProt AC â†’ Ensembl gene ID mappings: 81,097

### Open Targets data statistics
* Total OT targets: 60,608
  + Of them, protein coding: 19,933
* Total OT diseases: 18,497
  + Of them, genetic diseases: 8,147
* Total OT direct associations by datatype: 2,653,077
  + Of them, fitting all criteria (genetic association, good score, coding target, genetic disease): 13,697

### Upstream target list filtering
This is performed in a successive manner (one step after the other):
* On load: 6,742 distinct (6,742 total)
* Mapped to Ensembl gene IDs: 6,617 distinct (7,485 total)
* Present in the OT target index as protein coding: 6,385 distinct (6,439 total)
* Have good OT associations: 1,968 distinct (5,992 total)
